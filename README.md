# Evolutionary Music

An audio file to note list interpreter implemented with Evolutionary Algorithms. Given a short audio file, a list of notes is outputed, as well as an audio file replicated through an EA.

## Instalation

Python >3.6 is required. Once that is set up, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies

Evolutionary Music uses **pydub** and **pyacoustid** to evaluate the fitness of each note sequence, hence dependencies for these libraries have to be installed.

- [Pydub dependencies](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub/#dependencies)
- [PyAcoustid dependencies](https://github.com/beetbox/pyacoustid#installation)
